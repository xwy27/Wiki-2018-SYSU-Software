                Document at least one new substantial contribution to the iGEM community that showcases a project
                related
                to BioBricks. This contribution should be central to your project and equivalent in difficulty to
                making
                and submitting a BioBrick part.

                    Our project made it possible to design genetic circuits and cooperate with others in real time, as
                    well
                    as
                    build a model to predict its dynamic behaviour. This feature fit right with the engineering

                    which
                    iGEM advocates.
