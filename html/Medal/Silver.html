                Convince the judges that something you created (art & design, hardware, software, etc.) performs its
                intended function. Provide thorough documentation of this validation on your team wiki.

                <div class="content">
                    The software we created are tested versatilely, including Wet-Lab validation and compatibility
                    Testing. To ensure the circuits generated by our software will function as predict and the software
                    is able to run on all platform.

            Convince the judges you have significantly worked with one (or more) currently registered 2018 iGEM team(s)
            in a meaningful way. For example, mentor a team (or be mentored by a team), characterize a part,
            troubleshoot a project, host a meetup, model/simulate a system, or validate a software/hardware solution to
            a synbio problem.

                Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is responsible
                and good for the world. Document on your team wiki how you have investigated these issues and engaged
                with your relevant communities, why you chose this approach, and what you have learned. Please note
                that surveys will not fulfill this criteria unless you follow scientifically valid methods.

                    This year, as we are working on our project, SYSU-Software sent a group of team members to
                    Bio-Safety Committee office of Sun Yat-Sen University to consult the possible bio-threaten that
                    might cause by our software and how to avoid. Therefore we developed a series of approaches
                    preventing malicious people from creating something bad. Check SAFETY page for details.
