                Convince the judges that something you created (art & design, hardware, software, etc.) performs its
                intended function. Provide thorough documentation of this validation on your team wiki.
            </li>

            <li>
                Convince the judges you have significantly worked with one (or more) currently registered 2018 iGEM
                team(s) in a meaningful way. For example, mentor a team (or be mentored by a team), characterize a
                part, troubleshoot a project, host a meetup, model/simulate a system, or validate a
                software/hardware
                solution to a synbio problem.

                Convince the judges you have thought carefully and creatively about whether your work is
                responsible
                and good for the world. Document on your team wiki how you have investigated these issues and
                engaged
                with your relevant communities, why you chose this approach, and what you have learned. Please note
                that surveys will not fulfill this criteria unless you follow scientifically valid methods.

                        This year, as we are working on our project, some of our team members joined Bio-Safety
                        Committee
                        office of Sun Yat-Sen University to consult the possible bio-threats that might be caused by
                        our
                        software and the avoiding methods. Therefore we developed a series of approaches preventing
                        malicious people from creating something bad. Check SAFETY page for details.
