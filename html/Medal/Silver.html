                        This year, as we are working on our project, some of our team members joined Bio-Safety
                        Committee
                        office of Sun Yat-Sen University to consult the possible bio-threats that might be caused by
                        our
                        software and the avoiding methods. Therefore we developed a series of approaches preventing
                        malicious people from creating something bad. Check <a href="javascript:void(0)" goto="Wet-Lab">Safety</a> page for details.
