                    This year, as we are working on our project, some of our team members joined Bio-Safety Committee office of Sun Yat-Sen University to consult the possible bio-threats that might be caused by our software and the avoiding methods. Therefore we developed a series of approaches preventing malicious people from creating something bad. Check SAFETY page for details.
