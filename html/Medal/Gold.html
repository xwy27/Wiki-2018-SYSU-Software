                expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues
                into the purpose, design, and/or execution of your project. Document on your team wiki how your project
                has changed based upon your human practices work.

                During our Human Practice acitvities, we have received many thoughts and suggestion from wet-lab
                researcher and biosafety advisor, and found what our project CO-RAD should be improve. Then we further
                developed our software CO-RAD to improve efficiency while cooperating, and reassess our database for
                biosafety.

                Improve the function of an existing iGEM project (that your current team did not originally create) and
                document your achievement on your team wiki.

                this year, we futhure improve contraditional designer tools and introduce a new collaboration method in
                synthetic biology, making it possible for users to design their remote project with partners in real
                time.

                ​ Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have
                gained from modeling. This could be either a new model you develop or the implementation of a model
                from a previous team. You must thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on your
                team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, model results, and a clear explanation of your model
                that anyone can understand.

                We construct three models in our project for simulation, recommendation system and evolutionary.

                Convince the judges that your engineered system works.

                We are glad to invite you to use our software, check CO-RAD（超链接：软件网址） and enjoy the convenience and
                efficiency brought by it.
