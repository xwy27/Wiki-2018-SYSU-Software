                    During our Human Practice acitvities, we have received many ideas and suggestions from wet-lab researchers and biosafety advisors. We found the new direction for the improvement of our software. Then we further developed CO-RAD to enhance efficiency in terms of cooperation, and reassess biosafety level of our database.

                    Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have gained from modeling. This could be either a new model you develop or the implementation of a model from a previous team. You must thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on
                    your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, model results, and a clear explanation of your model that anyone can understand.
