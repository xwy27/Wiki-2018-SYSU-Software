                Expand on your silver medal activity by demonstrating how you have integrated the investigated issues
                into the purpose, design, and/or execution of your project. Document on your team wiki how your project
                has changed based upon your human practices work.

                        During our Human Practice acitvities, we have received many ideas and suggestions from wet-lab
                        researchers and biosafety advisors. We found the new direction for the improvement of our
                        software. Then we further developed CO-RAD to enhance efficiency in terms of cooperation, and
                        reassess biosafety level of our database.

                Improve the function of an existing iGEM project (that your current team did not originally create) and
                document your achievement on your team wiki.

                        This year, we futhure improve previous designer tools and introduce a new collaborative method
                        in synthetic biology, making it possible for users to design and manage their project with
                        partners in distant and in real time.

                Convince the judges that your project's design and/or implementation is based on insight you have
                gained from modeling. This could be either a new model you develop or the implementation of a model
                from a previous team. You must thoroughly document your model's contribution to your project on
                your team's wiki, including assumptions, relevant data, model results, and a clear explanation of
                your model that anyone can understand.

                        We construct three models in our project for simulation, recommendation system and evolutionary
                        algorithm.
