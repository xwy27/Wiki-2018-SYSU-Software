        As a software team, we aim to design software that will satisfy the current and potential needs for the field
        of synthetic biology. We also feel obliged to solve the other iGEM experimental teams with technical issues
        such as web design and data processing. Therefore, we have been actively participating in collaboration with
        other teams. We have reached out to 4 registered iGEM teams: XMU-China, SCUT-ChinaA, WHU-China and SYSU-China.

        In September, we had a meetup with XMU-China in Guangzhou. They proposed the need of efficient information
        gathering and subject optimization. In particular, They would like to have a software that can help them
        quickly find past iGEM subjects, which they can use as reference for their own project.

        Through this meeting, we realized the importance for synthetic biologists to get data of past experiments
        efficiently, so that they can optimize their own subjects based on past experience and generate new ideas. In
        response to their need, we built a database of past iGEM subjects and paper works, and designed a search engine
        dedicated to help user index the relevant information with minimal effort.

        Later, XMU-China tested our software and it successfully satisfied their initial requirements. Searching
        results provided by our software are highly consistent with their previous information.
