        We communicated with the team of SCUT-China_A, whose project is about metabolic optimization. During the
        discussion, they indicated that they had difficulty in wiki authoring. Since they are mostly biology students,
        they are not familiar with CSS. So our team members in charge of web design spent three days helping them with
        the code design of their web navigation function, and taught them some web design skills. Meanwhile, we were
        consicous that experimental protocol is also an important element in collaboration. Thus we added a new
        function of protocol edition in CO-RAD.
