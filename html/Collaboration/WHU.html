        During our meeting in SYSU campus, we exchanged ideas related to experiments and modeling. They faced the
        problem of measuring and analyzing the rate of detachment of bacteria and algae simultaneously in order to
        confirm the reliability of the two-wavelength method, which was established based on Beer-Lambert Law. They
        turned to us in hope of verifying the accuracy of their experiment. We helped them with data analysis and
        confirmed the stability of their method.
