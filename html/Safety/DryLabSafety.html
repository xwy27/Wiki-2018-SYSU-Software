  <div class="header3">Q: In biosafety, what items should we pay attention to?</div>
  <div class="content">
    A: The following two principles should be concerned. Firstly, choose a safe chassis for all your circuits.
    Secondly, only safe parts are available for your design. For more information, please refer to the GEM safety
    community announced <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Safety/White_List">2018 White List</a>.

  <div class="header3">Q: What about the safety level of your parts in CO-RAD?</div>
  <div class="content">
    A: Parts safety levels were seriously evaluated based on their original and applied chassis information.
    Specifically, we rid parts in Risk Group 3 & 4, and graded the rest parts into 3 safety level according to the
    following principles:
    <ul>
      <li>1 level: no "Red Flag" tag, belonging Chassis belongs to Risk Group 1.</li>
      <li>2 level: no "Red Flag" tag, belonging Chassis belongs to Risk Group 2.</li>
      <li>3 level: with "Red Flag" tag.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="header3">Q: Can safety be ganranteed when we use the parts?</div>
  <div class="content">
    A: Most parts in our database are in Risk 1, which can be used without any concerns, while parts in Risk 2 & 3 may
    lead to potential danger. To guarantee the safety of your design, CO-RAD will automatically display the safety
    level of parts when referred. Green, yellow, red represent Risk 1, 2, 3 respectively.

  <div class="header3">Q: How can users suggest the potential safety issues of others' circuit design?</div>
  <div class="content">
    A:<ol>
      <li>We attach importance to efficient collabaration in finding potential safety issues. Via comments, users can
        alert their partners in time. (Figure 4)
      </li>

      <li>Meanwhile, in order to prevent users from using dangerous chassis by mistake, users need to select chassis
        before sharing their circuits, and other users can view its information. (Figure 5) </li>
