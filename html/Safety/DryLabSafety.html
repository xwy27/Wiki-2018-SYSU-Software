  <div class="header3">Q:What about the biosafety matters to notice while using CO-RAD?</div>
  <div class="content">
    A: As a responsible iGEM team, we need to consider about safety level of circuits designed in our collaboration
    platform. There are two major parts in iGEM we need to consider about. First is to choose a safe enough Chassis to
    redesign the circuits. Second, we need a safe enough Parts as material to make a Gene blueprint that benefits human
    beings. Therefore, this year, iGEM safety community announced <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Safety/White_List">2018
      White List</a>.

  <div class="header3">Q:What about the source of parts and its safety level in CO-RAD?</div>
  <div class="content">
    A: The source information is stored in our database including the original chassis and the adapted chassis. The
    database has been screened manually.For safety in use, we only collected Parts belonged to Risk Group 1 &2, and
    prohibited Parts in Risk Group 3 & 4. For the rest parts, we divided them into three three safety level which is
    judged by two criteria:
    <ul>
      <li>1 level: no "Red Flag" tag, belonging Chassis belongs to Risk Group 1.</li>
      <li>2 level: no "Red Flag" tag, belonging Chassis belongs to Risk Group 2.</li>
      <li>3 level: with "Red Flag" tag.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="header3">Q:Are those Parts stored in the database of CO-RAD safe enough?</div>
  <div class="content">
    A: iGEM safety community has already accessed a series of Parts with Biosafety danger, and the 'Red Flag' tag was
    set in Registry. BY manually screening all Parts in database, we found there were only few that are tagged with
    'Red Flag'. For safety in use, we will alert users whiling using these parts.

  <div class="header3">Q:By cooperating with CO-RAD, will there be any potential dangerous operation?</div>
  <div class="content">
    A:<ol>
      <li>We think collaboration is a good way to find potential dangerous. With comment function, users can alerttheir
        partners in real time.</li>

      <li>At the same time, for preventing users using dangerous chassis by mistake, users need to selected chassis
        before collaboration, and others users can view it while cooperating.</li>
