    <div class="content">
        Our human practice project is used to guide the entire CO-Rad project in several aspects as: topic choosing,
        feature improvement and safety issues. We first carried out surveys and gatherings with other teams and
        professionals to learn about their need, then we based our project on this data, then we showed our results to
        the teams and professionals we got in touch with and made further adjustments about our project. To shoulder
        our obligation to the Syn-bio community and the entire society, we established a wechat public account and
        posed introduction of SYNBIO on it. We also encourage the readers to think out of the box so we had the global
        challenge as our special topic.

    <div class="content">
        Before the meetings, we hold a pre-survey first to guide the in-depth investigation. The survey was conducted
        among the iGEM teams both domestic and abroad to find out users’needs. we got feedbacks from 9 iGEM teams and
        it turned out that the top three difficulties that a normal iGEM team encounter are

        <ol>
            <li>
                experiment reproducing and validating(76% teams have troubles in this area
            </li>
            <li>
                finding new creative ideas(48% teams)
            </li>
            <li>
                searching for information(28% teams)

        Gatherings with professionals
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        We then chat with Prof.Lu about the situation we are in and asked for his opinions about the feasibility and
        utility of these ideas. Based on their own experience and knowledge, Lu lab suggested us to deal with the
        problems with interdisciplinary perspectives. When discussing the realization of the function, Lu lab thinks
        that the traditional remote collaborative methods is low-efficient and inconvenient, thus many researcher
        selected to meet their remote collaborators ,which costs plenty of time and energy. At the same time, remote
        collaboration make it difficult to come up with valuable ideas an suggestion.

        We also gathered with SCUT-ChinaA team to introduce our project to each other and exchanged our opinions. After
        introducing our co-editing function with a presentation，one of their team members gave a great suggestion about
        our project. He pointed out that we ignored the fact that experiment protocol is also an important element in
        design collaboration. As a result, we, together with the SCUT team, come up with the idea of protocol editing.

    <div class="content">
        Since we think highly of Biosafety, we consulted the university biosafety committee member Prof.LEE. about dry
        lab and wet lab biosafety(TODO:链接去到生物安全silver页面), had a member given an intrinsic talk to introduce concepts
        and related policies to other teammates. After that, a discussion about the potential methods that could be
        used to improve our project was addressed.

    <div class="content">
        The Human practice guided the improvement of this project to fit the users’ demand of information searching,
        experiment validating aid, ideas searching. Thanks to Prof.Lu for guiding our project design and we are also
        grateful to the SCUT-ChinaA team for helping us fix the defect of unable to edit protocol, we also got generous
        help from Professor LEE to improve our biosafety level.

    <div class="header4">
        Experiment validating
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        To solve problem in validation, we built a circuit predicting feature that uses OED models to simulate the
        function of the circuits. The users could in this way model their circuit design and get simulation of
        intermediate products and end products.

        Inconvenience in collaboration
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        we solved this problem by building a co-editing software to let different users co-operate and inspire each
        other as well as debug the design. the users can edit the same circuit in real time and have discussions on the
        project they are co-operating on. we also deveolp the shared sketchpad, imitating draft paper, to make the
        process of collaboration more convenient.

        Information searching
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        From the pre-survey and talk with XMU-China, we find it is important for synthetic biologists to get past
        successful experience quickly and accurately to optimize their own subjects, which can also be valuable to
        inspire users in the process of collaboration. To solve this problem, we consulted the former members of our
        team who build a searching engine, we improved last year’s searching function to make it more intelligent by
        adding a similar circuit searching feature.

        Protocol editing
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The gathering with SCUT-ChinaA team made us realized that protocol display is also crucial in co-operation so
        we added a protocol editing function to let the users share and co-edit their protocols for design
        improvements.
