        The aim of our human practice project is to guide the design of CO-RAD in aspects such as topic selection,
        feature improvement and safety issues. The design of our software was based on real-world requirements right
        from the beginning, and we invited professionals and other iGEM teams to test our software and give us their
        suggestions. Feedbacks helped the further enhancement of our software. We have also set up a public WeChat
        account about synthetic biology as a bit of contribution to the community.

        Before the meetings, we conducted a pre-survey to guide the in-depth investigation. Feedbacks from 9 iGEM teams
        were collected and the data turned out that the top three difficulties they encounter are :
        <ol>
            <li>
                Experiment Reproducing and Validating(76% teams have troubles in this area)
            </li>
            <li>
                Finding New Creative Ideas(48% teams)
            </li>
            <li>
                Searching for Information(28% teams).

    <div class="content">
        Professor Lu suggested that we should approach the problems with interdisciplinary perspectives. He also
        mentioned that researchers traditionally choose to meet their remote collogues because they lack efficient
        tools to communicate and work together. Working in different places also made it difficult for scientists to
        exchange and work on creative ideas in time.

        We also had a meeting with SCUT-ChinaA team. They particularly pointed out that experiment protocols are
        important in collaborating, something we didn't think of before. That's when we formed the idea of protocol
        editing.

        We also consulted Professor Lee, biosafety committee member of our university, in order to improve the safety
        standard for our software. He talked about biosafety issues for <a href="javascript:void(0)" goto="Dry-Lab"> dry lab </a> and 
        <a href="javascript:void(0)" goto="Wet-Lab"> wet lab </a>,
        and we discussed potential solutions to these issues.

        To solve problem in validation, we built a circuit predicting feature that uses OED models to simulate the
        behavior of the circuits. Users can have visual plot, which displays the production rates of product.

        Our real-time Synchronization Sketchpad let users work on the same project at the same time, where they can see
        what changes other people are making instantly. This specifically for idea sharing and brainstorming. Moreover,
        Management Studio is definitely reliable assistant for managing and sharing your circuit design. We believe
        that our software will redefine remote collaborating, leading it to a simple and efficient process.

        Synthetic biologists constantly need access to past projects and papers for reference and we try to make this
        process easier and faster by building a dedicated database and an improved search engine based on existing
        projects, with similar circuit searching featured added to make it more intelligent.

        After consulting Professor Lee's and the brainstorm among our team members, we checked all the existing parts
        and circuits in our database, removed those with potential risks, and added necessary warning messages in our
