        We organized a series of events to shorten the distance between synthetic biology and everyone of us.

    <div class="header3"> WeChat Public Account </div>
    <div class="content">
        We established a wechat public account and posed introduction of Syn-Bio on it. Introduction of synthetic
        biology, annual iGEM competition and SYSU-software can be view in it. To spark the interest of readesrs, we put
        forward 5 modern biological challenges and the comments from professors in our university. We also put forward
        a synbio solution to one of these challenges. Moreover, viewers can play Little Tomato with Big Dreams, whose
        details are stated below.

    <div class="header3"> Lectures for High School Students </div>
    <div class="content">
        We held a lecture in Guangzhou No.6 Middle School and Shenzhen Middle School respectively. On the lecture, we
        gave presentations to introduce the concept and the prospect of synthetic biology. Surprisingly, in Q&A
        session, many students raised lots of meaningful and profound questions, some of which even illustrated their
        creative ideas, leaving us deep impression. We also handed out the introduction brochure, and interacted
        directly with those keen on this field.

    <div class="header3"> Biology Festival </div>
    <div class="content">
        Biological Festival is one of the annual events in the School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University. This
        year, our team was responsible for introducing the field of synthetic biology, and we actively disseminated the
        basic concepts, prospects as well as current challenges of synbio. In particular, we paid lots of efforts in
        the depiction of standardized synbio features and the process of circuit construction, where all abstraction
        was described with electronic elements like AND/OR gates. Not only participants' passion flamed, but we also
        learnt about the public's understanding and attitudes towards this subject.

    <div class="header3"> An Interesting Game
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        To let people better understand the framework of circuit construction, we mimicked a hot game on Wechat and
        desigend Little Tomato with Big Dreams, where players need to help the little tomato grow as strong as possible
        by jumping on the box with the desirable circuit part.
