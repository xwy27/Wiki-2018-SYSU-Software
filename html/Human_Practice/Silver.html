    <div class="content">
        Our goal is to build a software that fits the needs of synthetic biologists, and is efficient and easy to use.
        To determine the specific functionalities we need to implement, we conducted a survey on researchers and other
        iGEM teams, including SCUT-China, Xiamen-China, and SYSU-Chin, and held a meeting with them to find out the
        problems they face on a daily basis.

        We took steps to ensure the biosafety of our project. Presentations and discussions about biosafety knowledge
        were regularly held during the developing period.

        We discussed about validation and safety of registered parts and existing circuit data. Several ideas were
        raised, such as giving alert to inform the user about the potential risks and limit the unregistered users to
        invoke the risky part. Members from other teams suggest that we rid the dangerous parts and circuits of the
        database.

        Consulting Prof.LEE about dry lab and wet lab biosafety
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        We consulted Prof.LEE in the university biosafety committee about safety information. We introduced our
        validating experiment and showed him the materials（parts and chassis microbes）and methods we used. He stated
        highly that our experiment is almost free of risk for all parts we had used were standardized and
        well-researched, proved to be out of potential danger. For dry lab biosafety, he suggested that we could
        enhance the constraints on using dangerous part in circuit design.

        Inspiration
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        As a platform on which many biologists participate to solve problems together, we have the responsibility to
        guarantee the circuits our software recommends and parts the users search are safe, therefore, when we gained
        some circuits and parts from former iGEM teams, we also took biosafety into consideration, in other words, the
        circuits and parts our software uses conform to the standard of biosafety.
        Our software ensures the safety of parts and circuits used in biological experiments by only including
        standardized and well-researched parts and circuits in our database, meaning that we check for biosafety
        whenever we add parts or circuits from former iGEM teams into our database. We have also put necessary
        authorization constraints on our software to protect the database from being tampered with. In addition, We
        give appropriate warning information whenever a part or circuit is requested by the user.
