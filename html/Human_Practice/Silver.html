        Meeting with other iGEM team.

    <div class="content">
        We held a meeting with several iGEM teams as SCUT-China, Xiamen-China, and SYSU-China to exchange opinions
        about our projects and try to find a way to build a software that fits the users’ demand and will be used
        regularly.

                Presentation and discussion inside our group
                <div class="content">
                    We carried out inside activity and outside counselling to ensure the biosafety of our project.
                    Intrinsically we had a group member giving a presentation about biosafety knowledge and hold a
                    discussion about what action can we take to ensure that our software is safe for the environment
                    and society.

                    During the discussion, we talked about how to let the users of our software use the registered
                    parts and existing circuit data responsibly. Our team members raised several ideas such as giving
                    alert in the software to inform the user about the potential risks and limit the unregistered users
                    to invoke the risky part. Other team members suggest that we wipe off the dangerous parts and
                    circuits from our database. Given the Safety first principles , we adopted all these ideas.

                    Extrinsically, we got in touch with the university biosafety committee member Prof.LEE for safety
                    information.

                Inspiration
                <div class="content">
                    As a platform on which many biologists participate to solve problems together, we have the
                    responsibility to guarantee the circuits our software recommends and parts the users search are
                    safe, therefore, when we gained some circuits and parts from former iGEM teams, we also took
                    biosafety into consideration, in other words, the circuits and parts our software uses conform to
                    the standard of biosafety.
