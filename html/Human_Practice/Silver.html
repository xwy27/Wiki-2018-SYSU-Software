        We first conducted a survey to understand the basic condition that the iGEM teams and professional researchers
        are facing. Then we held meetings with several iGEM teams as SCUT-China, XMU-China, and SYSU-China to exchange
        opinions about our projects and try to find a way to build a software that fits the users’demand and will be
        used regularly.

        Presentation and discussion inside our group

    <div class="content">
        We carried out inside activity and outside counselling to ensure the biosafety of our project. Intrinsically we
        had a group member giving a presentation about biosafety knowledge and hold a discussion about what action can
        we take to ensure that our software is safe for the environment and society.

        During the discussion, we talked about how to let the users of our software use the registered parts and
        existing circuit data responsibly. Our team members raised several ideas such as giving alert in the software
        to inform the user about the potential risks and limit the unregistered users to invoke the risky part. Other
        team members suggest that we wipe off the dangerous parts and circuits from our database. Given the Safety
        first principles , we adopted all these ideas.

        Consulting Prof.LEE about dry lab and wet lab biosafety
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Extrinsically, we got in touch with the university biosafety committee member Prof.LEE for safety information.
        We introduced our validating experiment and showed him the materials（parts and chassis microbes） and methods we
        used. He thinks that our experiment is almost risk free because all the parts we use are standardized and
        well-researched for potential danger. Previous experiment have proved the safety of such experiment. For dry
        lab biosafety, he suggests that we could do something about the database and the authorization of using such
        parts.

    <div class="content">
        As a platform on which many biologists participate to solve problems together, we have the responsibility to
        guarantee the circuits our software recommends and parts the users search are safe, therefore, when we gained
        some circuits and parts from former iGEM teams, we also took biosafety into consideration, in other words, the
        circuits and parts our software uses conform to the standard of biosafety.
