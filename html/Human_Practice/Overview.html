        As the bridge between CO-RAD and the real world, our human practice consists of three parts: professional
        opinions, biosafety concerns, and public engagement.
        Since professional opinions are extremely valuable, we held interviews with expert researchers and other iGEM
        teams in Sun Yat-sen University to listen to their views on software-aided biology research. As regards to
        biosafety, we also consulted the biosafety committee members in our university in order to make sure our
        software meets all the safety standards. As for public engagement, we made a presentation about synthetic
        biology in our Biology Festival to the whole school, and we als3o held a couple of mini-classes in high
        schools.
