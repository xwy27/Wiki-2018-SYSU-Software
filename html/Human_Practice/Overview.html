        Since human practice is the part in which we learn about how our work interacts with the entire world. We
        divided this work into professional, biosafety and public engagement part.
        In the professional part, we hold interviews with expert researchers at Sun Yat-sen University and five other
        iGEM teams to learn about their needs in software aids. In the biosafety part, we consult the biosafety
        committee members at our university. In the public engagement part, we gave an introduction of syn-bio
        principle to the general public at our department Biology festival and entered high school to give a small
        talk.
