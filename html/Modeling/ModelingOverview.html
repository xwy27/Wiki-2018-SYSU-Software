        What makes CO-RAD work are the clever algorithms behind it. For the sake of offering users superb experience,
        our modelling team uses advanced techniques to construct 3 main models in our project. As for the more powerful
        Search & Recommendation system, we mainly use TensorFlow to train 2 Deep Neural Networks for a great many of
        times. Besides, techniques like Ball Tree, Collaborative Filtering, Word2Vec Algorithm, Encoder-Decoder model
        and so forth equip our system with powerful skills to explore structure of the relationship between keywords
        and projects and then offer accurate recommendations to users. Meanwhile, for helping users have a deeper
        understanding of circuits and inspiring their idea while collaboration, we construct a highly robust ODE system
        to characterize a wide range of genetic circuits created by the users. Moreover, we use evolutionary algorithm
        to help users revise designs by calculating optimum kinetics parameters. All of these systems provide users
        with a state-of-the-art platform through thousands of rounds of successful tests.
