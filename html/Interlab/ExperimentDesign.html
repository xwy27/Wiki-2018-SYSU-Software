        We transformed 8 different plasmids, Positive Control (BBa_I20270), Negative Control (BBa_R0040), Device 1
        (BBa_J364000), Device 2 (BBa_J364001), Device 3 (BBa_J364002), Device 4 (BBa_J364007), Device 5 (BBa_J364008),
        Device 6 (BBa_J364009) into Escherichia coli DH5α, which were inoculated on LB plate with chloramphenicol
        (cmr). After an overnight cultivation, we picked single colonies to keep cultivating. After 6 hours of
        cultivation, we used Colony PCR to test if the plasmids were transformed successfully. And the successfully
        transformed colonies were moved into liquid cultures (LB medium) and cultivated overnight. Liquid cultures were
        diluted with LB medium until the value of OD600 reached 0.02. Then we took out 500 μL samples from the cultures
        at 0&6 hour. in the end we measured OD600 and fluorescence of all samples.
