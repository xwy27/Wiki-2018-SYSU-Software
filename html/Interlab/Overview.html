        We are proud to be part of the interlab study as a Software Team. We will never be separate from experiments
        and extinguish the passion for contributing our efforts for iGEM and Synthetic biology community. This year,
        Interlab study provide detailed protocol to let all participating teams to use plate readers to take
        measurements of fluorescence and absorbance, and find a way to reduce lab-to-lab variability in fluorescence
        measurements by normalizing to absolute cell count or colony-forming units (CFUs) instead of OD.
