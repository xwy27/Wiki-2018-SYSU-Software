        The bacteria were cultivated in Lysogeny Broth(LB) plate with chloramphenicol added when doing transformation.
        The plates were kept at 37°C. Colonies we picked were grown in 5ml LB medium with chloramphenicol. Afterwards,
        they were kept at 37°C and 220 rpm shaking frequency. We used 5ml LB medium and chloramphenicol to target OD600
        of 0.02.

        We used Escherichia coli strain DH5α cells for transformation. Three devices and two controls are all provided
        by iGEM HQ as follows:

        Generating FITC Fluorescence Standard Curve by Using Plate Reader
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        We have used 96-well plates to do the plate reader’s measurement. A serial dilution was performed to generate a
        FITC fluorescence standard curve. When measuring fluorescence, the excitation wavelength we set was 480nm(9),
        and emission wavelength was set at 535nm(20).

        Using LUDOX CL-X as A Single Point Reference
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        We used LUDOX CL-X to transform our absorbance data into standard OD600 measurement. Volumes of LUDOX was
        100μl. We prepared a column of 4 wells containing 100 μl LUDOX and 4 wells containing water. The samples were
        measured using plate reader.

    <div class="content">
        Colonies with devices tested by us were picked from the plates, then were cultured overnight in 5ml LB medium
        with chloramphenicol. The liquid cultures were diluted to target OD600=0.02. The fluorescence and OD600 of
        samples at 0&6 hours were measured by using 96-well plate. The volumes of samples were 100 μl LB medium with
        chloramphenicol were used as blank
