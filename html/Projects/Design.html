    CO-RAD is not a question-and-answer community website, we offer a new collaboration method for synthetic
    biologists. We believe that face-to-face communication is the most efficient way to collaborate, therefore, we
    want users to be as efficient as face-to-face communication with our newly designed real-time collaborative
    designer and shared sketchpad. Additionally, our vast database and mathematical algorithms provide users with
    new perspectives and thinking to help users come up with more valuable ideas when collaborating to improve the
    quality of collaboration.

    Good collaboration = convenient and quick way to collaborate + valuable communication content

<div class="ui header3"> New Ways of Collaboation:Real-time collaboration like face to face</div>
<!-- TODO: 应该有副标题，把上面的标题拆开来 -->


<div class="ui header4">Real-time Collaborative Designer </div>
<div class="content">
    There are various kinds of online collaboration software, such as Google Docs, which greatly improve the
    efficiency of teamwork. To this end, we hope to bring this effective way of collaboration into the field of
    synthetic biology. Unlike other design software that can only be used locally, the online design platform in
    CO-RAD can invite anyone to join, and with the permission, everyone's changes can be displayed on other
    people's computers in real time. Users can add any new components to the circuits on this platform, edit the
    relationship between the various devices, and even write the protocol used in the experiment to make their
    design more complete. At the same time, we also support historical version backtracking, and each change can be
    withdrawn.

<div class="ui header4">Shared Sketchpad</div>
<div class="content">
    In the process of face-to-face communication, it is very common to use pen and paper to express their ideas. In
    order to improve the efficiency of remote collaboration, we have developed the function of sharing sketchpad.
    With the circuit picture as the background, users can draw arbitrary content to express their own ideas, which
    will be displayed in real time on other users' computers.

<div class="ui header4">SBOL Support</div>
<div class="content">
    Our software is not a closed platform. In order to improve software compatibility, we support the import and
    export of SBOL files. This allows circuits edited on other software to be quickly imported into our software
    without having to re-edit.

<div class="ui header3"> Help Users Come Up With More Valuable Ideas</div>
<div class="content">

    Good collaboration requires good advice, and a good proposal cannot be separated from a summary of past
    successful experience, a deep understanding of existing designs, and sometimes computer assistance. To this
    end, we have developed several functions, hoping to enlighten users' inspiration and open up users' thinking.

<div class="ui header4">Search</div>
<div class="content">

    Every year, hundreds of teams participate in the iGEM competition, and a large number of synthetic biology
    literatures are published. By understanding these successful projects, users can improve their own experimental
    designs or provide more reliable advice for the designs of others. We have collected a lot of data stored in
    our database, including project from previous years' iGEM teams and well-known journals. Users can search for
    interesting projects by keywords and get inspiration for designing or optimizing their own designs.

<div class="ui header4"> Recommendation </div>
<div class="content">
    When a user builds a circuit on the design platform, our software will automatically recommend a project with
    similar circuits based on the user's circuit design.

<div class="ui header4"> Analysis </div>
<div class="content">
    Deeper understanding of the circuit design can help users put forward more constructive comments. CO-RAD can
    calculate two common values, the CG and CAI values of components, to assist the user in deciding whether to
    modify or optimize the components of the circuit.

<div class="ui header4"> Simulation </div>
<div class="content">

    CO-RAD can analyze the circuit designed by a user, and build corresponding mathematical models to provide a
    reference for him or her by simulating the expression of the product.
</div>

<div class="ui header4"> Guide the Design</div>
<div class="content">
    We use an algorithm that simulates the evolution of biological orientation to assist the user in modifying his
    or her own circuit designs. After the user determines the desired expression level, the algorithm simulates the
    process of reproduction, elimination, mutation, etc., and iteratively obtains the optimal component dynamics
    parameters. These parameters can help the user to modify or optimize his or her circuit parts
