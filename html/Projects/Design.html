        CO-RAD isn't just another question-and-answer community. It is an amazing experience specially made for
        synthetic biologists. Our real-time collaborative designer and synchronization sketchpad will make you feel
        like working side by side with your remote coworkers. The powerful databases and algorithms we provide empower
        you by stimulating your creativity, and you will find yourself doing a better job for your team efficiently.

    <div class="ui header3"> New ways of collaboration：Real-time collaboration like face to face </div>
    <div class="content">
        For a long time, collaborative biology-designed collaboration software simply sent its
        questions to a website and waiting for someone to answer. This method becomes inefficient when the number of
        users is small. Instead of creating a Q&A site, we want to create a collaboration tool that everyone can use to
        help synthetic biologists overcome the inconvenience of remote collaboration and make remote collaboration as
        valid as face-to-face communication.

    <div class="ui header4">Real-time Collaborative Designer </div>
    <div class="content">
        If you have a brilliant idea that you want to share with your colleagues right now, wouldn't it be wonderful if
        they can see it as you are writing it down? With our CO-RAD online design platform, team members can see each
        other's editions on the protocol in real time, as if they are using the same computer with multiple screens and
        input devices. You can also customize new tools via the platform for higher efficiency when you are editing
        relations between genetic circuits or writing experimental protocols. CO-RAD online design platform also comes
        with version control, so you don't ever need to worry about someone accidentally scrambling your protocol up!

    <div class="ui header4">Shared Sketchpad</div>
    <div class="content">
        It works like our Real-time Collaborative designer, but instead of making editorial contents on files or
        editing circuits, you get to doodle on a synchronization board and other people can see it as you draw and
        respond to you at the same time. Let ideas fly!

    <div class="ui header4">SBOL Support</div>
    <div class="content">
        Files formatted in SBOL can be loaded in our software without any re-editing or configuration. This allows you
        to collaborate seamlessly with people who are not currently using the same software as you.

    <div class="ui header3"> Help Users Come Up With More Valuable Ideas</div>
    <div class="content">
        High-efficient collaboration requires effective communication, and a proposal cannot be separated from a
        summary of past successful experience, a deep understanding of previous designs. As regard for this, we have
        developed several functions, hoping to enlighten users' inspiration and open up users' thoughts.
    </div>

    <div class="ui header4">Search</div>
    <div class="content">
        Each year hundreds of teams participate in iGEM and lots of synthetic biology papers are published. By learning
        from successful examples from the past, you can refine your own project or make valuable suggestions for
        others' work. Our database include former iGEM and well-known journal projects which can be searched by
        keywords.

    <div class="ui header4"> Recommendation </div>
    <div class="content">
        Our search module will automatically recommend a project with similar circuits based on the user's circuit
        design.

    <div class="ui header4"> Analysis </div>
    <div class="content">
        Deeper understanding of the circuit design can help users put forward more constructive ideas. CO-RAD can
        calculate two common values, the CG and CAI values of components, to assist the user in deciding whether to
        modify or optimize the components of the circuit.

    <div class="ui header4"> Simulation and evolutionary algorithm </div>
    <div class="content">
        With mathmatical models, CO-RAD can analyze the circuit to provide a reference for him by simulating the
        expression of the product.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        We use evolutionary algorithm to assist the user in modifying his own circuit designs. After the user
        determines the desired expression level, the algorithm simulates the process of reproduction, elimination,
        mutation, and iteratively obtains the optimal kinetics component dynamics parameters. These parameters can help
        the user to modify or optimize their circuit design.
