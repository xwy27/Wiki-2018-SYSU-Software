    <div class="ui header3"> Real-time collaboration like face to face </div>
    <div class="content">
        CO-RAD isn’t just another question-and-answer community. It is an amazing experience specially made for
        synthetic biologists. Our real-time collaborative designer and Shared sketchpad will make you feel like working
        side by side with your remote coworkers. The powerful databases and algorithms we provide empowers you by
        bringing out your creativity, and you will find yourself doing a better job for your team in no time.
        <br />
        effective tools + valuable content = good cooperation

    <div class="ui header4">Real-time Collaborative Designer </div>
    <div class="content">
        If you have a brilliant idea that you want to share with your colleagues right now, wouldn’t it be best if they
        can see it as you are writing it down? With our CO-RAD online design platform, team members can see each
        other’s edits on the file in real time, as if they are using the same computer with multiple screens and input
        devices. You can also customize new tools for the platform for higher efficiency when you are editing relations
        between genetic circuits or writing experiment protocols. CO-RAD online design platform also comes with version
        control, so you don’t ever need to worry about someone accidentally scrambling your files up!

    <div class="ui header4">Shared Sketchpad</div>
    <div class="content">
        It works like our Real-time Collaborative designer, but instead of making edits on test files or editing
        circuits, you get to doodle on a synchronization board and other people can see it as you draw and respond to
        you at the same time. Let ideas fly!

    <div class="ui header4">SBOL Support</div>
    <div class="content">
        If you have work on SBOL files on other platforms, you can use those files in our software without any
        re-editing or configuration. This allows you to collaborate seamlessly with people who are not currently using
        the same software as you.

    <div class="ui header3"> Help Users Come Up With More Valuable Ideas</div>
    <div class="content">
        Good collaboration requires good advice, and a good proposal cannot be separated from a summary of past
        successful experience, a deep understanding of existing designs. To this end, we have developed several
        functions, hoping to enlighten users' inspiration and open up users' thinking.

    <div class="ui header4">Search</div>
    <div class="content">
        Each year hundreds of teams participate in iGEM and lots of synthetic biology papers are published. By learning
        from successful examples from the past, you can refine your own project or make valuable suggestions for
        others’ work. Our database include former iGEM and well-known journal projects which can be searched by
        keywords.

    <div class="ui header4"> Recommendation </div>
    <div class="content">
        Our software will auto-recommend project that have similar genetic circuits as user’s current project.

    <div class="ui header4"> Analysis </div>
    <div class="content">
        CO-RAD computes CG and CAI, which are important values for a circuit. These values can help users detect
        possible optimization potentials.

    <div class="ui header4"> Simulation and evolutionary algorithm </div>
    <div class="content">
        CO-RAD can build mathematical models based on the circuit you have designed. It can give you an idea of the
        protein expression of the DNA.
        We can help you perfect your design using an algorithm that simulate the determinate evolution process. All you
        need to do is specify the goal protein expression, and the software will give you the best parameters via a
        simulation process of reproduction, biological elimination, and mutation. These parameters will be helpful for
        you to optimize the promoter, RBS intensity, or DNA sequence.
