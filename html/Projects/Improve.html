  <div class="header3"> SBOL Unification </div>
  <div class="content">
    SBOL is an open standard for the representation of in silico biological designs. Considering the powerful features of SBOL, it's viable to merge data from different databases into a consolidated database supported by SBOL, which will bring great efficiency and convenience to the communication among synthetic biologists. CO-RAD is a perfect software compitable of SBOL, where users can import and export data in format of SBOL.

  <div class="header3">Advanced Toolkit</div>
  <div class="content">
    Compared to traditional software such as SBOL Designer that is difficult to achieve efficient interflow when they
    have problems with their designs, CO-RAD offers a synchronization sketchpad for synthetic biologists to communicate
    with their remote partners. The embedded management studio is another reliable assistant for your circuit designs.
    We believe all these advanced toolkit will rid the tedious process of circuit designing.

  <div class="header3"> CG value and CAI </div>
  <div class="content">
    Last year the work of SYSU-Software only proceeded the analysis module of sequences, but it can't evaluate the circuits that the users designed. This year we want to provide the users with CG value and CAI about their circuits,  helping adjusting and improving their circuits. We have to point out that, it is not enough to make a comprehensive assessment on circuits by only CG value and CAI, yet these two parameters are still appropriate references, for they are closely related to the expression level of the product.

  <div class="header3"> Protocol </div>
  <div class="content">
    Previous projects of our team is not available for editing protocols. For the convenience of interaction, we add this function to CO-RAD, with which protocols can be easily edited and authorized users are able to view/comment protocols of others designs.
