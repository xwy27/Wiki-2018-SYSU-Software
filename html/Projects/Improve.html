  <div class="header3"> SBOL Unification </div>
  <div class="content">
    As we all know, SBOL language is considered as an officially standard language in iGEM. Therefore, if we can unify
    data from different databases into SBOL language, it will make the communication between synthetic biologists more
    convenient and efficient. And our software adds the import and export of SBOL form, which improves the
    practicability of our software.

  <div class="header3"> Real-time Collaboration </div>
  <div class="content">
    Compared to traditional software such as SBOL designer, which can help users design circuits in a SBOL form but
    difficult to achieve efficient interflow when they meet with some trouble in their design, we create a real-time
    collaboration platform, making synthetic biologists communicate with remote partners like face to face. And we
    believe real-time collaboration can offer the users a better experience when they design circuits.

  <div class="header3"> CG value and CAI </div>
  <div class="content">
    Last year we only proceeded the analysis of sequences and didn't evaluate circuits the users designed. And this
    year we want to provide the users with CG value and CAI about their circuits to remind the users to make some
    adjustment, in order to improve the circuits. Although it's not comprehensive to assess circuits only by CG value
    and CAI, however, these two parameters are closely related to the expression level of the product, which makes the
    evaluation have certain reference significance.

  <div class="header3"> Protocol </div>
  <div class="content">
    In previous projects of our team, we didn't have the function of editing protocols. And for the convenience of
    interaction, we add this function to our software. Additionally, it contributes to find the possible problems
    existed in protocols.
