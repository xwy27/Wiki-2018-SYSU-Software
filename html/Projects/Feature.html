    <div class="header3">Efficient Collaboration </div>

    <div class="content">
        CO-RAD provides a helpful collaboration platform for synthetic biology. First and foremost, our software is compatible to SBOL, the standard format that generally used in this field. Users can import and export data formated in SBOL and migrate them to any other SBOL-supported community with ease. Besides, CO-RAD overcomes the downsides in traditional method. Visual circuit designer and management mechanism are dedicatedly developed for the enhancement in synbio cooperation, where users can share their design and turn to others in no time. Additionally, synchronization sketchpad allows users to construct and design their circuit in real time together, no matter how physically distant they are. Undoutedly, all these tools will significantly increase working on synthetic biology.

    <div class="header3"> Information Reference </div>
    <div class="content">
        Previous works can be the source of creative idea. Search engine embedded in CO-RAD intelligently returns desirable results based on the input keywords, with which users can find former projects and papers in no time.

    <div class="header3"> Excellent circuit analysis module</div>
    <div class="content">
        To help users further analyse their circuits, we develop a series of ancillary functions. CG & CAI value of the products can be quickly computed in CO-RAD visual designer. Simulation module can predict the expression level of the products with mathematical ODE systems, and evolutionary algorithm can help users design a better  circuit by offering kinetics parameters of the parts used.
