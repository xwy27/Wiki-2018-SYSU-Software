    <div class="header3">Efficient Collaboratin </div>

    <div class="content">
        CO-RAD introduce a new collaboration method for synthetic biology and we develop many functions to help users
        cooperate with partners efficiently and easily. With the support of SBOL, users can load or save their circuits
        design as SBOL format, which is used widely by many synthetic biology software. For solving the problem of
        inefficiency in traditional collaboration method , we upgrade our designer into a new collaboration platform.
        User can view and edit their project with partners in real time. Meanwhile, shared artboard allows users to
        circle and draw anything to show their thoughts with remote partners, like writing on the scratch paper face to
        face. All these are designed for a efficient collaboration method in synthetic biology.

    <div class="header3"> Fast Information Retrieval </div>
    <div class="content">
        Users can feel free to search anythings they wanted and get valuable information easily in CO-RAD. Meanwhile,
        CO-RAD also recommend related circuits based on user’s design. All these are designed for users to raise more
        valuable ideas while cooperating.

    <div class="header3"> Excellent Calculation Simulation </div>
    <div class="content">
        To help users understand deeply about their circuits, we develop a series of ancillary functions based on the
        analysis of circuits. Users can get parts’ CG content & CAI easily on CO-RAD. Expression Simulation function
        can predict product expression with ODE system, and evolutionary algorithm can help users design a more desired
        circuits by offering kinetics value of parts.
