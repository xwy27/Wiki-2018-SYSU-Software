        CO-RAD realizes the visualization of circuit design, and one of the core features is its support for Biobricks,
        which are standardized and widely used in synbio. After users specifying the type, inputing the key of
        Bioblocks, the search engine will intelligently return the potentially desirable results in seconds. CO-RAD is
        able to provide the basic information of each Bioblock, including its type, description, safety level, etc.,
        which are all formated in SBOL standard.
