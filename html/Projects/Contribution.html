        This year, we develop a collaboration platform which allow users design their circuits with partners in real
        time like face to face. Given the standardization and widespread use of Biobricks, we recommend users to design
        their circuits by them. For this case, we develop a search bar for users to find any Biobricks they need easily
        and efficiently. What’s more, the advanced search function was designed to help users filter Biobricks with
        types, like Promoter, RBS etc. To each biobric, CO-RAD will show its type, description and safety level, and
        they were represented using SBOLv standard for easy identification.
