    In consideration of the stable, robust and friendly performance of Django with Python 3, we
    chose it as the back-end for CO-RAD, a web application; Sqlite3 with Django models binding gives us a lighter but
    still powerful database support; For front-end, we build the view with customized Semantic UI, and control the
    logic behind beautiful widgets using jQuery. Some other open-source JavaScript libraries are also used, such as
    Chart.js and echart.js for displaying chart, jsPlumb for showing the relationships in circuit in the design page,
    etc... jQuery and CSS3 was used to build the interesting game 'Little tomato with big dreams', hope you will enjoy it!
