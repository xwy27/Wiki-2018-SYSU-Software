    In consideration of the stable, robust and friendly performance of Django with Python 3, we
    chose it as the back-end for CO-RAD, a web application; Sqlite3 with Django models binding gives us a lighter but
    still powerful database support; For front-end, we build the view with customized Semantic UI, and control the
    logic behind beautiful widgets using jQuery. Some other open-source JavaScript libraries are also used, such as
    Chart.js and echart.js for displaying chart, jsPlumb for showing the relationships in circuit in the design page,
    etc... jQuery and CSS3 was used to build the interesting game 'Little tomato with big dreams', hope you will enjoy
    it!

  <div class="content">
    As is known to us, the users of our software are all innovative researchers who are interested in utilizing
    Synthetic Biology to tackle many different real-world problems. The purpose of our system is to recommend the most
    related projects to the users based on their research interests detected by our system.

    When it comes to the advanced algorithms behind our project, we mainly use Python3 to implete the Ball Tree,
    Word2Vec, Encoder-Decoder model and so forth in Machine Learning. As for the powerful Search & Recommendation
    system, we mainly use TensorFlow, an open source software library for high performance numerical computation, to
    train 2 Deep Neural Networks for a great many of times. Moreover, the collaborative filtering framework enables
    users to get accurate recommendation after offering their interest to our system, which is based on a database
    powered by Deep Neural Network.
