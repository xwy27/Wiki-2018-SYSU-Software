        Due to the complexity of biological systems, genetic circuit design and the limited personal experience, it is
        very difficult for individuals to design a viable circuit alone. To this end, many synthetic biologists choose
        to work together to complete a work. Good collaboration should ensure that the collaborative approach is simple
        and fast, and that the recommendations made by both parties are valuable when collaborating. In a collaborative
        approach, working together with face to face is undoubtedly the best choice for collaboration, but in many
        cases it is tough to achieve. When collaborating remotely, traditional collaboration tools, such as Google
        Docs, couldn’t describe genetic circuits and experimental protocols integrallty and accurately. Localized
        design software, such as SBOL designer, cannot be edited online in real time, resulting in collaboration
        inefficient. In addition, there are no tools to help users come up with more valuable opinions.
